## Thematic queries

- SQL queries can be performed with file import

```{r}

tlm3d_path <- "data/Spatial_Analysis_II/swiss_TLM3D.gpkg"

tlm_seen <- read_sf(
  tlm3d_path, 
  query = "SELECT objektart, geom FROM tlm_bb WHERE objektart = 'Stehende Gewaesser'"
  )
```

---

- However, datasets can also be queried after import using `data.frame` methods (such as `[` or `dplyr::filter`)

```{r}

tlm_bb <- read_sf(tlm3d_path, "tlm_bb")

# Subsetting with base-R
tlm_seen <- tlm_bb[tlm_bb$objektart == "Stehende Gewaesser", ]

# Subsetting using dplyr::filter
tlm_seen <- filter(tlm_bb, objektart == "Stehende Gewaesser")
```


## Spatial queries using binary predicate functions

Take the following example:

> Select all forests in the canton of Luzern

- Spatial query functions include: `st_contains()`, `st_contains()`, `st_contains()`, `st_contains()`, and many more
- These spatial queries are called [geometric binary predicates](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_pred.html) 

---

- This family of functions return so called *sparse matrices*: a `list` the same length as `x`, which, for each element in `x`, contains the indices of `y` where the condition is met. For example:
- They *could* return cross matrices, but these usually have a larger memory, since they have are $x \times y$ in size

---

```{r}
luzern <- read_sf("data/Spatial_Analysis_II/swissBOUNDARIES3D.gpkg")

tlm_wald <- filter(tlm_bb, objektart == "Wald")

# The dataset already has this crs (2056), but apparently 
# does not realize this
tlm_wald <- st_set_crs(tlm_wald, 2056)


query_res <- st_intersects(tlm_wald, luzern)
```

---


```{r}
# Note the length of the output equals nrow(tlm_wald)
query_res
```


- (The first 10 elements are empty, because these are not within Luzern)
- This list can be used to subset `x` (`TRUE` where the list is not empty):


---


```{r}
#| fig-cap: Note how some forests are outside the canton's border. This is the nature of `st_intersects`. If even a small part of a forest feature is within Luzern, this feature *intersects* Luzern and is therefore retained. To query only forests that are *completly* within Luzern, use `st_within()`.
#| label: fig-intersects

# Note the use of lenghts (with an s) to get the length of each element in the 
# list
wald_luzern <- tlm_wald[lengths(query_res) > 0,]


ggplot(luzern) + 
  geom_sf(data = wald_luzern, fill = "darkgreen") +
  geom_sf(color = "red", fill = NA) 

```


## Spatial queries using `[` or `st_filter`

- The code above was for illustration purposes. The code can be written more concise: 


```{r}
#| eval: false

# using sf-methods in base-R
tlm_wald[luzern,, op = st_intersects]

# using st_filter
st_filter(tlm_wald, luzern, .predicate = st_intersects)

```

- The default value for `op` and .predicate is `st_intersects`, so these arguments could also have been omitted


## Overlay Analysis


- In the example illustrated in @fig-intersects, we have the choice of subsetting forests that either intersect Luzern ever so slightly (`st_intersects`), or that lie *completely* within Luzern (`st_within`). 
- Depending on the question, both options can be unsatisfactory (e.g. if the question was *Which percentage of Luzern is covered by forest?*)
- For some cases, it might be necessary to "cut" the forest area at the cantons border

---

- This can be achieved with `st_intersection` (which is different from `intersects`)
- There are several other functions that work on pairs of geometries. See  [Geometric operations on pairs of simple feature geometry sets](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_ops.html)
- There are even more functions that work on single geometries, e.g. `st_buffer`. See [Geometric unary operations on simple feature geometry sets](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html)


---

```{r}
library(glue)
library(scales)
wald_luzern2 <- st_intersection(luzern, wald_luzern)

ggplot(luzern) + 
  geom_sf(fill = "gray", color = NA) +
  geom_sf(data = wald_luzern2, fill = "darkgreen", color = NA)

```

---

- Now, it's possible to compute the area of Luzern and the forest that *intersects* Luzern using the function `st_area`.
- There are several functions to [compute geometric measurements](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_measures.html) of `sf`-objects.

```{r}
sum(st_area(wald_luzern2))/st_area(luzern)
```

## 🪕 Tasks


From the exercise in **Spatial Analysis I**, solve the following tasks using R:
   
- Task 2: Thematic Selections (Select by Attributes)
- Task 3: Exporting Selected Features to a New ~~Layer~~ `sf` object
- Task 6: Intersect (Intersection)
- Task 8: Buffer
- Task 9: Spatial Selection (Select by Location)
