You have access to topographic data from Swiss TLM3D and administrative boundaries. Your task is to use appropriate spatial analysis methods to answer the questions described in the task.\n\nChoose at least 2 Tasks (\"Szenarios\") and solve these!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAll data is available on moodle, under the section *Spatial Analysis I*:\n\n- **swiss_TLM3D.gpkg** contains:\n  - `tlm_bb`: Land cover polygons with attribute `objektart` (Wald, Stehende Gewaesser, Feuchtgebiet, Fels, Lockergestein, Gletscher, etc.)\n  - `tlm_strassen`: Road network with attribute `objektart` (Autobahn, Autostrasse, various street widths, paths, etc.)\n- **swissBOUNDARIES3D.gpkg** contains:\n  - `kantonsgebiet_lu`: Canton of Luzern boundary\n\nAll data use CRS EPSG:2056 (CH1903+ / LV95).\n\n## Scenario 1: Protected Area Planning\n\nThe canton is considering establishing a nature protection zone for wetland ecosystems. To inform this decision, you need to analyze the current state of wetlands.\n\n- **Question 1.1:** How much wetland area (\"Feuchtgebiet\") currently exists in the canton of Luzern (in km²)?\n- **Question 1.2:** Wetlands are ecologically most valuable when they are connected to water bodies. Identify all wetlands that are either directly adjacent to or within 50 meters of standing water bodies (\"Stehende Gewaesser\"). What percentage of the total wetland area does this represent?\n- **Question 1.3:** Create a map showing:\n  - All wetlands in the canton\n  - Wetlands connected to water (highlighted differently)\n  - Standing water bodies\n\n*Think about: Which spatial operations do you need? How do you define \"connected\"?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Scenario 2: Accessibility Analysis\n\nA hiking organization wants to understand forest accessibility in Luzern.\n\n- **Question 2.1:** Calculate the total forest area in Luzern that is accessible by small paths (1m or 2m wide paths: \"1m Weg\", \"2m Weg\"). Define \"accessible\" as being within 200 meters of such a path.\n- **Question 2.2:** What percentage of Luzern's total forest area is accessible by these small paths?\n- **Question 2.3:** Compare this with accessibility by major roads (Autobahn, Autostrasse, and streets ≥6m). How much forest area is within 200m of major roads? \n- **Question 2.4:** Create a visualization that effectively communicates your findings.\n\n*Think about: How do you combine multiple road types? How do you avoid double-counting areas accessible by multiple paths?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Scenario 3: Alpine Environment Analysis\n\nClimate researchers are interested in high-altitude features in Luzern.\n\n- **Question 3.1:** Identify all rocky areas in Luzern by combining the following land cover types: \"Fels\", \"Fels locker\", \"Felsbloecke\", \"Felsbloecke locker\", and \"Lockergestein\". What is their total area?\n- **Question 3.2:** Some of these rocky areas may contain glaciers or permanent snow. Find all rocky areas that are within 100 meters of glaciers (\"Gletscher\") or snow fields (\"Schneefeld Toteis\"). How much area does this represent?\n- **Question 3.3:** Create a map showing the spatial distribution of:\n  - All rocky areas\n  - Rocky areas near ice/snow\n  - Glaciers and snow fields\n\n*Think about: Are glaciers and snow fields already part of rocky areas, or separate? How does this affect your analysis?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Scenario 4: Integrated Analysis\n\n**Research Question:** The canton wants to identify potential locations for small reservoirs for agricultural water supply. Suitable locations should meet ALL of the following criteria:\n\n- Located in or near wetlands (within 20m)\n- Within 300m of an existing road (any type, for construction access)\n- NOT in protected forest areas\n- NOT on steep rocky terrain (Fels, Felsbloecke)\n\n**Task:** Identify and map all suitable areas. Report the total area available and discuss the spatial distribution of suitable locations.\n\n*Think about: This requires combining multiple spatial operations. What is the logical sequence? Do you need union, intersection, or difference operations?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
