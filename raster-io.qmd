# Raster Data I/O

- In R, several libraries are available to work with raster data
  - `{raster}` by Robert Hijmans. This library is not maintained anymore
  - `{terra}` by the same author. This library is the successor of `{raster}` and is actively maintained
  - `{stars}` by Edzer Pebesma. This library extremly well developed, but it tends to be slower than `{terra}` (which is why we will not cover it in this course)
- Like `{sf}` The library `{terra}` is based on the GDAL library (see @sec-gdal-ogr2ogr)
- GDAL Supports a *wide* range of raster formats (see [Raster drivers](https://gdal.org/en/latest/drivers/raster/index.html))


## Import a raster file

- `terra` uses the function `rast()` to import raster data
- Printing the object will give you some basic information about the raster
  - The number of rows and columns, as well as the number of layers
  - The resolution of the raster, meter per pixel (25 in our case)
  - The extent of the raster, in the coordinate reference system of the raster
  - The coordinate reference system (CRS) of the raster
  - The source (in memory, or a file path)
  - The name(s) of the band(s) (we only have one band in our case)
  - The min and max values of the raster

```{r}
library(terra)

dhm25 <- rast("data/Spatial_Analysis_II/dhm25_lu.tif")
dhm25
``` 



## GeoTIFF

- GeoTIFF is the most common raster format
- GeoTIFF is an extension to the TIFF format, which includes additional metadata to establish the spatial reference of the file
- This includes the CRS, the extent, the resolution, and the origin of the raster
- The metadata is either stored in the header of the file, or in an accompanying file with the same name, but different extension (`.tfw` or `.aux.xml`)
- Other important raster file formats include:
  - Cloud optimized GeoTIFF (COG): A GeoTIFF file that is optimized for cloud storage which allows for efficient, partial reading of the file over HTTP
  - JPG2000 (`.jp2`) is a compressed raster format that is often used for satellite imagery
  - NetCDF (`.nc`) is a format that is often used for climate data
  - HDF5 (`.h5`) is a format that is often used for remote sensing data



## Writing a raster file


- You can write a raster object to a file using the `writeRaster()` function


```{r}
writeRaster(dhm25, "data-out/dhm25_lu.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
```


## ðŸª• Tasks


1. Import the raster `dhm25_lu.tif` from the lesson *Spatial Analysis II*
2. Visualize the raster using the `plot()` function as well as the library `{tmap}`.
